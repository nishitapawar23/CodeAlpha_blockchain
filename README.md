# Blockchain Internship Tasks

This repository contains all tasks for my blockchain internship, implemented in Solidity.

## Task 1: Simple Storage Smart Contract
- **Description**: A contract with an integer variable, increment/decrement functions, and public readability.
- **Files**: [Task1/SimpleStorage.sol](Task1/SimpleStorage.sol)
- **How to Test**: Compile in Remix IDE, deploy, and test increment/decrement.

## Task 2: Multi-Send Smart Contract
- **Description**: A payable contract that distributes Ether equally to an array of addresses using a loop.
- **Files**: [Task2/MultiSend.sol](Task2/MultiSend.sol)
- **How to Test**: Deploy in Remix, send Ether via `distribute` function, and check balances.

## Future Tasks
- Add details here as more tasks are completed.

## General Instructions
- All contracts are compiled with Solidity ^0.8.0.
- Test on Remix IDE (remix.ethereum.org) using Remix VM.
- Deployed addresses (if any): [Add here]

# Multi-Send Smart Contract

This is Task 2 for my blockchain internship: A Solidity contract that distributes Ether equally to multiple addresses.

## Features
- Accepts an array of Ethereum addresses.
- Payable function to receive Ether.
- Loops to send equal amounts and checks for success.

## How to Use
1. Compile in Remix IDE.
2. Deploy on Remix VM.
3. Call `distribute` with Ether and address array.
4. Test balances to confirm distribution.

## Contract Address (if deployed on testnet)
[Add address here if applicable]
